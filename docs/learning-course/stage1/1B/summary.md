## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 1B! Keep up the good work! Remember that practice is key - the only way to get better is to model more.

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in stage 1B:

* Learned about speed, torque, and mechanical advantage
* Learned the basics of motors, bearings, shafts, gears, chain and sprockets, and belt and pulleys
* Learned how to model basic power transmissions
* Learned how to use the `Belt & Chain Gen`, `Shaft`, and `Part Lighten` Featurescripts
* Learned how to use the `Origin Cube` FRC functions Featurescript for chain and belt c-c's
* Learned how to insert Standard Library components and mate bolts and nuts
* Learned how to use the `Replicate` tool
* Learned how to insert models into assemblies using the MKCad parts library

Again, it should be noted that Stage 1B is a very basic introduction to modeling power transmissions and some details were glossed over. Stage 2 will introduce how to *design* power transmissions - selecting motors and calculating optimal ratios. 

<!-- For future reference, you can refer to the [Design Handbook](/design-handbook/) power transmissions pages, which are more in depth. -->

In stage 1C, you will begin to learn the basic workflow for robot modeling. This is the final step before being able to design a full mechanism!
