# 1B: Power Transmissions

## Shafts and Bearings
### Shafts
Shafts transmit rotational power along an axis, with hex shafts being the most common in FRC. These hexagonal shafts, typically in 1/2" and 3/8" diameters (measured from flat to flat), may sometimes have rounded corners, known as "rounded hex" or "Thunderhex."

### Bearings
Bearings allow shafts to spin independently of plates and/or things to spin independently of shafts. Standard hex shafts use 1/2" hex bearings, while rounded hex shafts can use round bearings for easier assembly.

### Modeling
The easiest way to model shafts is to use the [`Shaft` Featurescript](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/95c00401c440b44ad8799ef5/w/1f1ebce01a3b8eb6fa102975/e/8db1f48368bdac821997185f "Shaft Featurescript Onshape Document"){:target="_blank"}, which you learn how to use in the following exercises. 

For bearings, insert your desired bearing from the MKCad app.
