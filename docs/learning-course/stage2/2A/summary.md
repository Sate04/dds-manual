## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 2A! With the Stage 2A tasks completed, your drivetrain model is well on its way to being fully functional. 

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in 2A:

* Learned about battery mounting and the importance of a secure battery holder
* Learned about core FRC electronics and how and where to mount them
* Learned how to use the `Electronic Mounting` Featurescript
* Optionally learned how to pocket a bellypan
* Learned about bumpers, how to model them, and the importance of having a secure mounting system
* Practiced more complex sketching and layout

As you progress, the projects will become more and more open ended and less step-by-step tutorial style as they have been up until now. Be sure to use the Discord to solicit feedback on your designs to learn and improve!
