# 2A: Full Detail Drivebase

Welcome to Stage 2! This section covers FRC mechanism design, emphasizing CAD skills, best practices, and key engineering concepts. Each project guide explains design decisions and criteria, promoting independent CAD work with less step-by-step instruction.

## Introduction

The first project in Stage 2 will be detailing the drivebase you began modeling in Stage 1B. So far, you’ve only modeled the frame and bare bellypan. **To finish the drivebase, you should add the following details.**

1. **Battery Mounting:** Every robot needs a battery, and while the location may vary based on the other mechanisms present in your robot, it should always be placed as low as possible to make the robot more stable.

2. **Electronics Mounting:** Adequate space must be allocated on the robot for ease of wiring. Typically, the robot’s electronics are mounted on the bellypan.

3. **Bellypan Pocketing:** This step is optional. Some teams will prefer to add cutouts in their bellypan to remove weight and make wiring easier. However, pocketing the bellypan may significantly increase machining time.

4. **Bumpers:** While bumper rules can vary from year to year, they are almost always required to protect your robot and other robots from collisions. Making your bumpers easy to attach and remove is also a very nice quality of life improvement for when you’re at competition.

While the exact implementation for each of these details will vary based on the rest of your robot and from team to team, an example reference for Stage 2A is provided.
