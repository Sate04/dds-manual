# 2C: Dead Axle Pivot

## Friction

Friction must be minimized since the mechanism pivots around the axle. This can be done using either bushings or bearings. Bushings can handle higher loads at lower speeds, while bearings are more suited for higher speeds and lower loads, but larger bearings can be used for large dead axles.

### Reference Design

The reference design utilizes 7/8" ID bushings for the arm pivot to match the 7/8" OD tube axle. Bushings are used for this dead axle example because they package well, are suitable for the low speeds and potential higher loads of an arm, and it is easy to source ones made specifically for sprockets and tube from FRC vendors.
