# 2B: Basic Shooter

## Shooter Mechanisms

Shooters are used in FRC games when you need to score in high places but are not allowed to physically reach up to the scoring position. A flywheel is the most common method of scoring as illustrated below. 

While most shooting games involve launching a ball, the fundamentals between ball shooters and shooters for non-spherical objects (discs or rings) remain roughly the same.

### Flywheel Shooters

The most common way to launch game pieces is with flywheel shooters. Other methods, such as catapults or punchers, tend be more challenging to execute with the required accuracy/fire rate and rely on different concepts than flywheel shooters.
